    "Standardized testing has long been used to measure student achievement, but it fails to capture the full scope of a student's abilities. \n",
    "While some argue that tests provide objective data, they often reduce learning to memorization rather than critical thinking. \n",
    "A single test cannot reflect creativity, collaboration, or problem-solving skills—all essential in real-world settings. \n",
    "Moreover, standardized exams disproportionately disadvantage students from under-resourced backgrounds, reinforcing existing inequalities. \n",
    "Instead of focusing on test scores, schools should adopt a more holistic approach to assessment. \n",
    "Project-based learning, portfolios, and teacher evaluations offer more comprehensive insights into student growth. \n",
    "Countries like Finland, known for top-performing education systems, have minimized standardized testing and instead emphasize trust in teachers and student-centered learning. \n",
    "Their success demonstrates that meaningful education doesn't need to be driven by exams. \n",
    "In conclusion, standardized tests should not define academic success. \n",
    "Schools must evolve to measure what truly matters: the ability to think, create, and apply knowledge in diverse contexts.\n",
